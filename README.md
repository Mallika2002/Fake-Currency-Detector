# Fake-Currency-Detector
This Project is all about detecting a specific currency whether it is a fake or genuine currency.
It is basically a flask application embedded with an ML model that initially get trained with some currency i.e., training images and then takes some test images and detects if they are fake or not.
This is a machine learning base project that majorly deals with the usage of training and testing images and validates the model constructed.
it makes the use of various Image Processing Techniques that help to trace down unique features of each currency and thereby facilitate in the currency validation later.
